WeatherCL
=========

WeatherCL is a simple command-line utility written in Python that accesses the API of [Open Weather Map](www.openweathermap.org). As long as the weather.py is in your system PATH, you can query the weather of a particular place directly from the command line:

$> weather.py "Montreal, QC"
