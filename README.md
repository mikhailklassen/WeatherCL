WeatherCL
=========

WeatherCL is a simple command-line utility written in Python that accesses the API of [Open Weather Map](www.openweathermap.org). As long as the weather.py is in your system PATH, you can query the weather of a particular place directly from the command line:

$> weather.py "Montreal, QC"

WeatherCL will return something like:

    The weather in Montreal, Canada right now:

    Temperature: 29.01째C. Feels like: 27.58째C.
    Today's High: 30.00째C. Today's Low: 27.00째C. 
    Relative Humidity: 61%
    Atmospheric Pressure: 0.9929 atm / 1006.00 hPa / 754.62 mmHg
    Sky is clear
